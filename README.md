//Figma your Life
//Created a website about the best bowler in the world, Jason Belmonte. My website consisted of 3 pages, the landing page, his accomplishments and his interests. In the code, I just made sure that I edited most of the boot strap components to fit my website, and I used a good amount of rows, containers and columns.
//Peer Review: Ashur Nanno: well done in design the pages; everything matches the orignial design in Figma; the only thing I could find is that if you zoom in and out the images get squished but everything will stay in the same width so the zoom in/out effect the hights only.
